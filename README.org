 This notebook reproduces key plots in the data guide paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11170) in python. The Jupyter Notebook focuses on gravitational wave event GW150914, and covers issues such as windowing and fourier transforms, power spectral estimation, maximizing the likelihood for numerical relativity templates and exploring correltations in the data and residuals.
